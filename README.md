Affiliate-System
================

This system is a simple affiliate marketing system which was developed for an organisation that I ran called Koanhosting, the application was intended to allow people to state that they had passed a client on to our website and processed an order, the us as the admin, would then be able to verify the order that the users stated they had processes, and accept the request.

This system was written as an expansion of the Simple Sales Billing System, as most of the key features remained the same, but the new system adds better reporting and figures, showing sales and estimates for payments to clients. The system is also written in Ruby with the Ruby on Rails framework.

Here's one of our old koanhosting adverts, just for fun, pretty irrelevant, but pictures make everything look better :D
